This project includes data and analyses for MacNeill et al. 2025 "Nectar metabolomes contribute to pollination syndromes" New Phytologist. 
In this repository there are analyses for individual level data, and our the three main hypotheses tested: Chemical pollination syndrome, Passive Leaking, and Phylogenetic signal. 
Data files needed to run these analyses can be found on this github repository and are referenced in their analyses in the R file, mzXML files for the samples can be found on a massIVE repository.

The main file (including all analyses run in Rstudio) is listed as "RstudioFile". This has demo code for calculating species averages from individual averages, ANOSIM analyses at the species and individual levels, phylogenetic signal testing using Moran's I and 
Blomberg's K, and a test of the Passive leaking hypothesis.
